# Taco Tracker

### About

In 2018, I ate 280 tacos. At the beginning of the year, I had friends guess how many tacos they thought I would eat. Taco Tracker is a tool for tracking my taco consumption and guesses in 2019.

### Features

Users will be able to create an account, submit a guess, view the taco count and blog, like posts on the blog, and view posts they have liked.

Admins will be able to add a taco consumption event and view the list of users and their guesses. A taco consumption event will consist of the number of tacos, rating, description, source, and photo.
